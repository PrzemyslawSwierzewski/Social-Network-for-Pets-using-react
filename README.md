# My work

Everything that i write in this exercise is in the Random.js. Started with giving the component Random the contstructor method and parametr named props and setting the state to a random RGB color. Inside of the <h1 /h1> I called the .formatColor() function and passed in this.state.color as an argument. Next i export the button function from Button.js and gave my <Button /> this attribute: light={this.isLight()}. Next I bind the handleClick in contructor method to be able to use handleClick in my button.
